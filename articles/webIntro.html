            <p>Web development involves developing a website for the website. The term development involves programming, documenting testing and bug-fixing involved in creating and maintaining a website (or framework).</p>

            <p>It might involve developing static pages (Pages that involve only html and css) . To the most sophisticated web-based internet applications (web-app), e-business and social network services. </p>

            <p>You should know though that threres a difference between a web developer and a web designer. A web developer is one who programs or codes applications for the world wide web. </p>

            <h4>Aspects of web development involves</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>client-side scripting, </li>
              <li>server-side scripting</li>
              <li>data base technology</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Client-side programming involves all programs run on the client (user’s computer or browser). It is used to make interactive pages. Make things happen dynamically on a page. Interact with the local storage. It carries out operations on the web browser whether mathematical or logical. Operations may be carries out on the client side because they require access to information or functionality     that is available on the client but not on the server. Some times the user may need to obsrve the operations or provide input, also some operaitons need to be performed by the client eithout sending data to the server as it may take less time, use less bandwidth and incur less security risk.</p>
            <h4>To carry out client-side operations, one needs knowledge of:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Javascript</strong> </li>
              <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
              <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Jquery</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <h4>Server-side</h4>
            <p>
              Server side programming really, involves work done on the back end of a website.Its usefulness lies in the need to host files and images in a database on a webserver (because the end-user’s computer is sometimes limited).
              It is a type of programming language that relies on code operated from the server of a wesite and not the computer that is actually accessing it. The bulk of the work in interpreting the code and running tasks Is done on the server and not the computer client (user’s browser). Here the code is embedded in order to allow for the computer to read it.
            </p>
            <h5>Server-side languages involvethe following</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Asp.net</strong></li>
              <li><strong>C</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Java</strong></li>
              <li><strong>PHP</strong></li>
              <li><strong>python</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Ruby</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Node.js (a javascript framework)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It should be noted that client side development is done almost exclusively in javascript.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

             <h3>Database technologies</h3>
             <p>
               Finally as a web developer , you  need to be familiar with a database technology. This is the technology involved in storing code, images, files and other data. A database is a computer based record keeping system which is used to record, maintain and retrieve data. A database management system is a collection of interrelated files and set of programs which allows users to store retrieve and modify  information. It is responsible for creating , editing , deleting and generally maintaining a database or collection of daily records.  There are several types of DBMS. But the most popular is relational dbms
             </p>
             <h4>Here are some examples of DBMS frameworks</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Oracle  </strong> </li>
                <li><strong> Microsoft SQL server  </strong> </li>
                <li><strong>MySQL  </strong> </li>
                <li><strong> IBM db2  </strong> </li>
                <li><strong> Apache  </strong> </li>
                <li><strong> Mongo db. </strong> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you are like me that doesn't do much coding here, in it will be useful if you know the basics and know how to use the GUI of the application (if it has any). The one I use often is  phpMyadmin.</p>
